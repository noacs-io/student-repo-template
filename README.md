# Student kit

**I'm happy that you're considering taking on a project with me as your supervisor!**

This repository includes some generic information that applies to most projects that I supervise. It also outlines my expectations on our
collaboration, and what you can expect from me as your supervisor.

To get the most out of this repository start by reading about the [project timeline](project-timeline.md) and my
[expectations](expectations.md).

## Short bio

I am an Associate Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, and a Resident in
Anesthesia and Intensive Care at Function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital, both in Stockholm,
Sweden. My primary line of research is the prediction and prevention of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, and my focus has so far
been on the development and validation of prediction models for early trauma care as well as the evaluation of system level interventions
for improved trauma care. Most of my research is based in India where I have coordinated multicentre projects since 2013. My research is
funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, and the Laerdal Foundation.

## My expectations of you as the student

- Complete a detailed project timeline with relevant dates based on the [generic timeline](project-timeline.md).
- Arrange weekly or bi-weekly phone meetings, with me or your co-supervisor(s).
- Keep detailed meeting notes and make these accessible to me (for example as a markdown document in the project repository).
- Submit on deadline. I don't expect submissions to be perfect or final but I expect them to be on time.
- If you for some reason cannot keep the deadline then make sure to inform me and/or co-supervisor(s).
- Respond to emails and messages on slack as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours.
- I manage every project as if it would result in a publication in a international peer-reviewed journal. I expect you to be interested in
  this endpoint as well.

### What you can expect from me

- To keep deadlines.
- To reply to emails/messages on Slack within 48 hours (sooner if you specifically ask me to).
- Comment on written work within 5 days from submission.
- To be closely involved with the project and invest time and effort in your supervision.

## Project Timeline

Refer to [project-timeline.md](/project-timeline.md)

## Workflow

### Project Structure

The `main.R` file will house your primary analysis code. However, for specific tasks, such as a `clean_data()` function, you should save the
code in the `functions` folder. Results generated from main.R can then be imported into your Rmarkdown document

### Rmarkdown

Your documents, including the project plan, seminar drafts, and final versions, will be crafted using R via RStudio. They'll be in Rmarkdown
(.Rmd) format, not a Word format (.docx).

You'll utilize Git and Github for collaboration. When you reach significant milestones, such as completing a section or addressing feedback,
update the Github repository. Use Rstudio to add the updated files and then click the "Push" button. Keeping these files up-to-date is
crucial as they're where you'll receive feedback.

Before submitting a document for external review/grading you will save (knit) the Rmarkdown as a docx file and style it according to the
official styling requirements.

## Resources

- Git in Rstudio (if using our Rstudio instance, only step 3 and 4 are needed):
